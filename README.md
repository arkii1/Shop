This is a React project built as part of The Odin Project. It covers all the core react features such as:
- React components,
- JSX,
- States and props,
- Handleing input,
- Lifecycle methods,
- Hooks,
- Routers,
- Testing react.

Note this is still a work in progress and there are still some visual bugs/features not finished.
